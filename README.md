## Project Overview and Key Takeaways (- 1~2 months)
This project stands as the culmination of a year-long journey through the BrainStation Bootcamp, showcasing the comprehensive skills and knowledge acquired during the web development program. The focus of this capstone project was on demonstrating proficiency in various aspects of web development.

The development process primarily centered around mastering the intricacies of Firestore database operations, which demanded substantial time and attention. Consequently, the allocation of resources between backend database functionalities and frontend development became a significant challenge. As a result, the frontend design suffered due to time constraints.

### Key Takeaways

#### Prioritize UI Design 
Reflecting on the project, a notable learning is the importance of initiating projects with a solid UI design foundation using tools like Figma. The simultaneous coding of frontend elements while designing had an adverse impact on consistency and cohesiveness. In the future, starting with a well-thought-out design would lead to a more visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

#### Utilize Frameworks Early 
The late-stage adoption of Bootstrap for enhancing the user interface highlights the significance of choosing and integrating frameworks at an earlier stage. Although it enhanced the UI experience, time limitations prevented its full implementation across all project sections.

#### Serverless API Development
Given more time, the implementation of a serverless API using Firebase's functions would have been a valuable addition. This step could streamline backend processes and enhance the overall project functionality.

#### Time Management
The project underscores the necessity for effective time management. A more balanced allocation of time between research, development, and design could lead to a more polished final product.

#### Database Expertise
Improving proficiency in accessing and fetching data from Firestore databases, along with a deeper understanding of user authentication mechanisms, would greatly enhance the project's backend functionality.

In retrospect, this project serves as a platform for growth and learning, offering insights into areas of improvement for future endeavors. The experience gained from navigating these challenges will undoubtedly contribute to creating more sophisticated and successful projects moving forward.


## Technology Stack
The project utilizes the following technology stack:

* Vite
* React
* JavaScript
* HTML5
* Bootstrap CSS
* Sass
* npm

## Notes and Updates
Please ignore the ``functions`` folder (it is supposed to be a serverless API in the future but right now it does not have any functions yet).
Version 2 is in progress. Main goal is to update the layouts accommodating larger screen sizes so it can provide a much more user-friendly interface. Boorstrap will be used for future ui frameworks.

## Key Functions
### Commission Board
The Commission Board provides users with a centralized location to view all available commissions posted by other community members. A filtering feature is also implemented to help users find commissions that align with their preferences.

### Your Commissions
Users can submit their commission requests to the board, seeking assistance from the community. Additionally, this section allows users to manage the commissions they have accepted or posted.

### Message
The Message feature facilitates private communication between users, enabling them to offer help as a helper or seek advice as a client for commissions.
